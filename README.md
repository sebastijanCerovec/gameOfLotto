A simple C++ project - Game of Lotto
## Description
My first upload to GitHub is a simple C++ project - the game of Lotto. You pick your numbers one by one, then the game draws numbers and checks if and how many numbers you hit. I've uploaded a gameOfLotto.exe file (Windows-based) if you want to try it out.
## Getting Started
### Setting up
* The entirety of the code is in the main.cpp file. Just start a new empty C++ project in your IDE (I've used Visual Studio 2022, so VS is preferable because in other IDEs you might get minor differences) and copy the main.cpp file to source files.
* I've added a solid number of comments where I thought they would be useful. At the top of the main.cpp file there are 2 integer constants declared and intialized. Constant DRAW is the number of drawn numbers. Constant POOL_OF_NUMBERS is the pool of numbers, obviously. You can change them to any Lotto combination you want.
